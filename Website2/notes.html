        <div class="title">Thinking Like a Programmer</div>  
        <div class="paragraph">                A large goal of this Nanodegree program is to give you practice thinking like a computer programmer.

            Longtime programmers will often talk about how the programming thought process has helped them in other areas of their life, 
            but what does it mean to "think like a programmer?" In this Nanodegree program we will focus on five specific ways of thinking
            that all programmers have to use all the time. We will come back to these ideas repeatedly throughout the Nanodegree program.
        </div>
        
        <div class="title2">1. Procedural Thinking </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer
            to follow. It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards, but getting a computer to do that requires more thought.
            But once you've learned to think this way you'll find that computers can do it much faster. 
        </div>

        <div class="title2">2. Abstract Thinking</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things. In this Nanodegree
            program you will visit hundreds of Udacity web pages. It would be impractical for a programmer to specifically program each
            of these pages individually. The Udacity programmers used the power of what's called abstraction to avoid unnecessary repetition
            of work. 
        </div>

        <div class="title2">3. Systems Thinking</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces. Programmers
            do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work. It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making
            about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it. If this is unclear now, don't worry!
            You'll understand what this means much more clearly by the end of the Nanodegree program. 
        </div>

        <div class="title2">4. Technological Empathy</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            "Technologicalempathy" comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works,
            and what it's good and bad at doing. A computer is a tool, as are the programs we use and the programming languages used
            to write them. It's almost impossible to program anything substantial without a basic understanding of how these tools work.            
        </div>

        <div class="title2">5. Debugging</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't
            work. When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake (also known as a "bug") somewhere in the computer code.
            Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming, every good programmer has a system for fixing them and that
            system usually looks something like this: 
            <ol class="list">
                <li> Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?) 
                <li>Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?) 
                <li>Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?) 
                <li>Fix the problem
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">   
         <div class="title">Template elements of HTML</div>
            <ol class="list">
            <li>The first line is something that should appear on every webpage you make. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> defines the type of the document so the browser will render it correctly.</li>
            <li>The html tag opens our document. Everything that shows on the webpage is placed within this tag.</li>
            <li>The head tag defines metadata for our web page. This includes the title of the page (this is what appears in the top of your tab or browser window). Notice that the
            <em>head</em> tag is indented to a new level because the
            <em>html</em> tag was opened but not closed (a new idea was started but not completed). More so, the title tag is indented
            another level further (the head tag was opened but not closed). </li>
            <li>The title tag is closed on the same line it was opened
            which we usually do if the content of a tag is short. On the other hand, the head tag is closed on a different line.
            The closing tag is indented to the same level as the matching opening one. Now take a look at the contents of the body
            tag. Is there anything about the structure that is surprising to you? Notice that inside the body tags you have the content
            of the web page. You can see an h1 tag that is indented just inside the body as well as a p tag that is on the same level
            of indentation as the h1. This is an important distinction. Both the header and paragraph are child elements of the body.</li>
